This project will be similar to a problem that we solved at Label Insight.  There are two types of text strings split into two files: human.txt, and machine.txt

Using these two sets of data, make a model to classify the two sets.  You can use any combination of techniques and/or metrics that you like. 

At the end you will be asked to submit your code and a presentation.  Again, this can be in any format that you like.   If you feel most comfortable combining the presentation with the code, then a single Jupyter notebook is completely acceptable.  We will mainly be interested in justifications for choices of method and metrics as well as any analysis that guided these choices.  Overall accuracy will not play a strong role in our assessment.
