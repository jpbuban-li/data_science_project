This project will be similar to a problem that we solved at Label Insight.  There are two types of text strings split into two files: human.txt, and machine.txt

Please note:  each line is considered a unique data point.

Using these two sets of data, make a model to classify the two sets.  You can use any combination of techniques and/or metrics that you like. 

At the end you will be asked to submit your code and a presentation.  Again, this can be in any format that you like.   If you feel most comfortable combining the presentation with the code, then a single Jupyter notebook is completely acceptable.  We will mainly be interested in justifications for choices of method and metrics as well as any analysis that guided these choices.  Final model accuracy will not play a strong role in our assessment, but the code itself will be considered for the decision to move to the final round.

When finished, please zip your files in a single folder and email to: jbuban@labelinsight.com
